    “It's hard to pinpoint any one element that makes the Electric Picnic so special, but if I were to hazard a guess, I would have to say the friendly and relaxed atmosphere.” <strong> - Resident Advisor.</strong>
    <br>
    “There was a wealth of talent, with far too many acts to cover and too little time to enjoy.” <strong> - Cluas.</strong>

     The Picnic remains the only Irish festival truly worth their time and euro. I can honestly say I'll be attending the festival for many years to come. Roll on 2009!<strong> - Efestivals</strong>
    <br>

	<h1>2009</h1>

     “As the sun sets in Stradbally after a hectic weekend for all, Electric Picnic has once again proven itself as the top Irish festival on the circuit.”<strong> - Golden Plec</strong>
   <br>
   <br>
“Another superb year for Electric Picnic, despite the weather, and let us hope that organisers keep with the boutique, quirky nature of this festival for as long as possible.” <strong> -  Limerick Leader</strong>
	</p>
	<h1>2010</h1>
	<p>
     “Aside from the downpour at the end, this was a tremendous weekend of music and was without question the venue of some of the best festival performances in this country for years.”<strong>  - Entertainment.ie</strong>
	</p>
	<h1>2011</h1>
	<p>
      Picnic regular will never tire of saying, there is so much more to the festival than the music. So with all that in mind here is our purely subjective take on the best and worst of Electric Picnic.<strong> - Meg.ie</strong>
	</p>
	<h1>2012</h1>
	<p>
      Overall, EP 2012 was amazing. The combination of the sun and the  impressive line-up meant you couldn’t help but enjoy the weekend. It was great to see that families were still welcome, and still came. The brief worries of the younger Oxegen crowd arriving en masse and changing the atmosphere were quickly forgotten. Nine years running and it has only gotten better. Roll on EP 2013!<strong> - University Times</strong>
	</p>
	<h1>2013</h1>
	<p>
      “EP tops again for consistent choices that reflect the original integrity of the festival”.<strong> - Festivals.ie</strong>
	</p>
	 <p>
      “The atmosphere, the whole set up and of course, the music was absolutely amazing”.<strong> - Retro-Flame</strong>
	</p>
	<h1>2014</h1>
	<p>
  “It’s a chance to escape your day-to-day life and share music and magic in a huge field with complete strangers, many of whom become your best friends for 72 hours.” <strong> - IMAGE Magazine.</strong>
	</p>
	 <p>
  “Electric Picnic once again served up one of the best festival experiences that you can have. Its winning formula is the sheer amount of side attractions at the festival, relaxed atmosphere and peerless organization”.<strong> - Chasseur Magazine</strong>
	</p>
	<h1>2015</h1>
	<p>
  “Electric Picnic was brilliant, bigger and better – and it hit every spot”<strong> -  Irish Independent</strong>
	</p>
	<h1>2016</h1>
	<p>
    Electric Picnic might not be the hippy free-for-all that it once was, but it would be strange if it had remained static considering all of the mutation and expansion it has undergone in recent years. <strong> - drownedinthesound.com</strong>
